The Git Repository for Emmanuel Exiga's JS Fundamentals Quiz.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to challenge my knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a JavaScript fundamentals quiz. It has buttons, a responsive timer, and a question bank. The quiz punishes the user for choosing a wrong answer by deducting time. The project also deploys the use of the JS built-in library to randomly pull questions and randomly order the answers. The questions can also be customized; please refere to the comments located in the quiz-page/script.js file.
